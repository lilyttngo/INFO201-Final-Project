                           p("The analysis of education's impact on median household income over the last two decades reveals considerable variability. Notably, education seems to have a 
                             more pronounced impact on income in urban areas, which may be attributed to the concentration of jobs requiring higher educational qualifications. 
                             In contrast, rural areas show greater fluctuations, with recent trends indicating a potential downturn in income benefits from education. These findings 
                             underscore the complex relationship between educational attainment and economic prosperity, which is influenced by a myriad of factors beyond education 
                             itself.\n\nIn rural areas, the distribution of education levels appears to be weighted towards high school completion, with a significant percentage of adults 
                        holding only a high school diploma, as indicated by the prominent light purple bar. This suggests that in these areas, completing high school is a common 
                             educational milestone. Moreover, there is also a substantial representation of adults with less than a high school diploma, marked by the red bar, which may 
                             point to barriers to educational access or attainment in rural regions. Conversely, higher education levels such as a bachelor's degree or higher and four 
                             years of college or higher, denoted by the blue and pink bars, respectively, have a smaller percentage. This could reflect limited opportunities for higher 
                             education in rural areas or perhaps less demand for such qualifications in the rural workforce.\n\nOur analysis over the past two decades shows that counties 
                             with higher levels of educational attainment typically exhibit not only higher median wages but also lower unemployment rates. This trend highlights the critical role of education in securing economic prosperity and stability. Notably, the data suggests that urban areas, with a higher concentration of individuals holding bachelor's degrees or higher, tend to outperform rural areas in both median wages and employment rates, further emphasizing the transformative power of education across different societal sectors."),
